# Simple-ai-image-generator - Description
This is a basic image generator written in Javascript with custom CSS styling. It utilizes the OpenAI image API and is setup to search for images with 1024x1024 dimensions. 
Upon cloning the directory, a user will need to add their own API key on the first line of the "app.js" file.
Once the repository has been cloned and the API key has been configured, simply start the image generator from the terminal using the command "start index.html"
